# JetBrains Rider Retro Pong Game

This is a sample [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/) game inspired by the [example found here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master), with a few improvements and modifications. This game uses C# as the scripting language and [JetBrains Rider with the Godot Plugin](https://jetbrains.com/rider) as the code editor.

I custom-built visual assets except for the CRT shader, which I sourced from [godotshaders.com](https://godotshaders.com). 

Audio files were sourced from [https://pixabay.com](https://pexabay.com).
